# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- I was motivated by the desire to build a better career for myself.
- I built this project to graphically make a study guide in the form of a web page.
- This project stores my notes on a webpage and separates them by language (HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript)
- I learned that small details and steps can have a huge impact on a project

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
